    <h1>History of Astrology</h1>
    <p>Astrology, the study of the movements and relative positions of celestial bodies interpreted as having an influence on human affairs and the natural world, has a rich history that spans thousands of years. While it's practiced in various forms around the world, Hindu astrology, also known as Jyotisha, holds a unique place in the astrological traditions.</p>

    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>Hindu astrology can be traced back to ancient Indian scriptures known as the Vedas, which date back to 1500-500 BCE. Jyotisha, which literally means "light, heavenly body," is one of the Vedangas, or limbs of the Vedas, which are texts that are intended to help in the interpretation and ritual application of the Vedas.</p>

    <h2>The Zodiac and Astrological Signs</h2>
    <p>Hindu astrology uses the sidereal zodiac, which is based on the fixed constellations. This is in contrast to Western astrology, which uses the tropical zodiac, based on the position of the sun relative to the earth.</p>

    <h2>Key Components</h2>
    <p>Jyotisha is divided into three main branches:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Siddhanta</strong>: Astronomy</li>
        <li><strong>Samhita</strong>: Mundane astrology, predicting important events related to countries such as war, earthquakes, political events, financial positions, electional astrology; house and construction related matters (Vāstu Śāstra), animals, portents, omens, and so on.</li>
        <li><strong>Hora</strong>: Predictive astrology in detail.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Jyotisha not only focuses on the interpretation of celestial bodies but also on their harmonious balance, aiming for an understanding of karma, free will, and the cosmic plan.</p>
