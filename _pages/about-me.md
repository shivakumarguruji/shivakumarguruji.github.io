# About Me

Hello! I'm Shivakumar Avadhani, a Hindu astrologer with over 25+ of experience in Jyotisha. My journey into the realms of astrology began at a young age, under the guidance of H L Nanjunda Avadhani, a renowned astrologer in Hosahalli-Mattur.

## My Philosophy

I believe that astrology is a tool to understand our karma and destiny, offering insights into our past, present, and future. My approach combines traditional techniques with modern insights to provide guidance and solutions to those seeking clarity in their lives.

## Services

- Muhurta (electional astrology)
- Vastu Shastra consultations

Feel free to contact me for a personal consultation or if you have any questions about my services.
